OMAP GLUE AND OTHER OMAP SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

OMAP MUSB GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "ti,omap4-musb" or "ti,omap3-musb"
 - ti,hwmods : must be "usb_otg_hs"
 - ti,has_mailbox : to specify that omap uses an external mailbox
   (in control module) to communicate with the musb core during device connect
   and disconnect.
 - multipoint : Should be "1" indicating the musb controller supports
   multipoint. This is a MUSB configuration-specific setting.
 - num_eps : Specifies the number of endpoints. This is also a
   MUSB configuration-specific setting. Should be set to "16"
 - ram_bits : Specifies the ram address size. Should be set to "12"
 - interface_type : This is a board specific setting to describe the type of
   interface between the controller and the phy. It should be "0" or "1"
   specifying ULPI and UTMI respectively.
 - mode : Should be "3" to represent OTG. "1" signifies HOST and "2"
   represents PERIPHERAL.
 - power : Should be "50". This signifies the controller can supply upto
   100mA when operating in host mode.

OMAP CONTROL USB

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,omap-control-usb"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
   the address of "control_dev_conf" and "otghs_control".
 - reg-names: The names of the register addresses corresponding to the registers
   filled in "reg".
 - ti,has_mailbox: This is used to specify if the platform uses mailbox in
   control module.

omap_control_usb@4a002300 {
	compatible = "ti,omap-control-usb";
	reg = <0x4a002300 0x4>,
	      <0x4a00233c 0x4>;
	reg-names = "control_dev_conf", "otghs_control";
	ti,has_mailbox;
};
